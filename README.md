# ryan-k-garcia

Hello, I’m Ryan Garcia—a full stack software developer with a passion for solving real-world problems through code. My interest in technology started early, but I took the leap professionally when I decided to shift gears from self-study into an immersive bootcamp at LearningFuze, where I completed over 800 hours of hands-on training.

During that time, I built projects from the ground up, using technologies like React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. These projects helped me bridge the gap between basic web design and full application architecture—including RESTful APIs, authentication, database design, and responsive UI development.

I bring a proactive mindset, curiosity, and a strong drive to continuously learn and contribute. I’m currently seeking a role where I can apply what I’ve learned, collaborate with other talented developers, and continue growing as a software engineer.
